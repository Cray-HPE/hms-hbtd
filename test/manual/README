Manual Tests

Preparation:

 o Compile fake-hsm.go  (go build fake-hsm.go)
 o Build HBTD into a binary and copy into this directory.

Run Tests:

 o runMe.sh -- happy path testing.  Comments in the script indicate what should be happening
   in HBTD.

 o runMeHSMError.sh -- similar test, but forces fake HSM to throw errors in some cases.
   Comments show what should be happening in HBTD.

 o runMeHSMDelay.sh -- similar test but forces fake HSM to have a 20 second delay in some
   cases.   Comments show what should be happeing in HBTD.
