 o Dockerize. (Q4)

 o Add into DST pipeline.

 o API gateway (Q4)

 o Secure, https, etc. (Q4)

 o Add code to dump onto the telemetry bus (Q4 +)

 o Use standard .ini file parsing stuff or KV store (when?)

 o Add code to connect to Kafka bus

Possible performance improvements:

 o Use a GO routine per SM PATCH rather than one GO routine with
   a queue of operations.

 o If a single GO routine is to be used, re-use the http.NewRequest() and/or
   the http.Client between calls.

Notes:

 o How do we know if a node is supposed to lose heartbeats (don't send
   any notification)?  Do nodes send a special value stating "I'm going
   down"?  Or, do agents that send shutdown notifications also tell the
   HB tracker to stop tracking?  That seems onerous.

   The former seems better.  But this means that this HB tracker has to 
   interpret special "status" text patterns.  Maybe this is OK?

 o Do we want to boot-track?  If so, we need to listen for SCNs for when
   nodes are starting to boot.  Puts more load on SM, but only one more
   client.
